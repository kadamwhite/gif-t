# Gif-T

This project is based on [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start)@[62d428a](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start/commit/62d428a1a51303c9a33c691b487c1998ba78faf8)

----------------

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](http://electron.atom.io/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start).
